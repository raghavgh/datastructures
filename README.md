# List Data Structures Implemented in Golang
This module provides custom list and queue data structure

# CustomList
In the custom list every data stored in nodes and it's have doubly linkedlist type of structure and 
I have also used hashing to store indexes to speed up basic operation.

This data structure provide you ability to do following operations:

1. GetAll: This operation gives you all data present in list.
2. PushBack: This operation push data into back side of list.
3. PopBack: This operation pop the last element present in list.
4. PushFront: This operation push data into front side of list.
5. PopFront: This operation pop the first element present in list.
6. Remove: This operation removes data at particuar index.
